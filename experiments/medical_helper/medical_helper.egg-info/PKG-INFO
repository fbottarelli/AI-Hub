I want to develop an app to track my health in a simple yet effective way. The idea is to create a personal tool to manage wellness-related information, such as treatments, medications, diagnoses, and other aspects of daily health - essentially a smart health diary.

The app, at least in its initial version, should allow:

- Adding, modifying, viewing, and deleting health information in a simple and organized way
- Storing documents or images, like a photo of a doctor's diagnosis, saving them with useful metadata for search and organization
- Providing a solid foundation for a more complete system in the future

Long-term, I'd like to integrate AI-based features, for example:
- Automatic analysis of medical documents
- Smart reminders for medications or appointments
- Personalized suggestions based on history

Technologies:
- Streamlit for the frontend (for now)
- Python for the backend
- For a future version, I'd like to use AWS for the backend and React for the frontend
